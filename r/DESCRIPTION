Description: Compute per-edge similarity values on graphs using the
    DRESS (Diffusive Recursive Structural Similarity) algorithm.
    Supports weighted/unweighted and directed/undirected graphs.
    Iterative fixed-point fitting converges to stable edge scores
    that capture neighbourhood overlap structure.
